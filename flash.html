            <h1>Main Idea</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Our idea is an errand app called “Flash” to assist 
                people to complete tasks that they do not have time 
                to do. The errand app will source highly rated service 
                for overwhelmed/busy professionals customers to free up their time.

            </p>

            <h1>Use Case diagram</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                After the installation of the application, the user will 
                be required to sign up for an account. Signing up requires 
                a valid email, phone number and home address. In addition, 
                payment information must be provided for automatically charging 
                for the services used. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When the user comes across a task that needs to be done around 
                the house but finds that they don't have the time to complete 
                it. Then they can list it on the app. The listing requires a 
                description of the task, the estimated time the user wished 
                it to be done. After listing the task, the information goes public 
                to Task Runners and they can accept your task for the list. When a 
                Runner shows interest in your task you have a chance to screen them 
                based on user reviews before accepting them. After accepting, the 
                two parties can make arrangements to begin the task. The price will 
                depend on the distance of the task or different types of task. Full 
                payment is not released to the Runner until the task is complete.
